Assembly reflection:
  What did you notice about registers and instruction?
        Registers store data while instructions are code which execute to perform a specific 
    function.
    
  How is coding in Assembly different from Python?
        In assembly we have to specify where exactly does the information need to be stored,
    for example in which register etc. In python we need not to specify it. Python is 
    closer to english while Assembly is more closer to machine code 1s and 0s. For example
    in python for output we only have 1 line command while in ASM we have multiple lines of
    code for simply printing Hello World.

Python Reflections:
  Why is Python easier/faster for building the same project?
        Python is a high level language that has similar syntax to english and can execute the 
    same code. 
  Which features of python helps abstraction(variable, functions, loops)
        Python being a high level language having functions mainly allows it to have abstraction,
    while variable and loops play supporting roles to acheive this.

Comparision Table:

| Feature          | Assembly Example | Python Example |           Notes          |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Variable storage | Register (EAX)   | `x = 5`        |ASM is longer than Python |
| Printing output  | `INT 21h`        | `print()`      |ASM is longer than Python |
| Arithmetic       | `ADD AX, BX`     | `x + y`        |ASM is longer than Python |
